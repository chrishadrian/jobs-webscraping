# Jobscraper
Looking at the vast amount of job postings out there, I feel so unproductive to look into the description, qualification, and salary of each job manually. Jobscrapper is a one-time solution to solve this problem. This app will allow you to save a lot of time by doing all those things with webscrapping method and store only the essential information into a database. This way, user can easily view, sort, and compare those information with SQL syntaxes in a more effective way. In this project, I am going to use Python for webscrapping, and SQLite as the database.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to scrape at least three of these items: description, qualification, and salary.
- As a user, I want to be able to store the retrieved information to a SQL database.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the retrieved information in the database.
- As a user, I want to be able to filter the retrieved information based on one or more categories (using SELECT in SQL).
- As a user, I want to be given the option to store the information to a CSV file.
